1. Code to find if a year is a leap year:

      def is_leap(year):
          leap = False

          if year%4 == 0 and year%100 != 0:
              leap = True
          elif year%400 == 0:
              leap = True
          return leap

      year = int(input())
      print(is_leap(year))


2. To print in the same line without space


      if __name__ == '__main__':
          n = int(input())

      i = 1
      while i <= n:
          print(i,end ='')
          i = i + 1

      This prints all numbers upto the number n    

      Note: end = "\n" is the default which shifts the print command to the next line

3. Defining a class

      Classes are used to define our own datatypes.  (Defining the attributes of the particular object as per our need)
      So using that class we can create an actual object.

      Syntax of making a class:

      class student:
          def __init__(self,name,age):
              self.name = name
              self.age = age

      Then using the class formed we can create an actual object which will have the attribute name and age.

      example:

      student1 = student('Rajat',27)

      Then we can create class functions in python, that is the functions inside the class which 
      we can call to do some operations after taking the input from the user.
      
      
 4. Code to find out angle between two planes, formed by 4 points
 
        Note: The input here is 4 vector points in 3D space, that is having x, y and z coordinate axis


       import math

      class Points(object):
          def __init__(self, x, y, z):
              self.x = x
              self.y = y
              self.z = z

          def __sub__(self, no):                                   # a class function to subtract two vectors
              x = self.x - no.x
              y = self.y - no.y
              z = self.z - no.z
              return Points(x, y, z)

          def dot(self, no):                                     # a class function to do dot product of two vectors
              x = self.x * no.x
              y = self.y * no.y
              z = self.z * no.z
              return x + y + z

          def cross(self, no):                                        # to do cross product
              x = self.y * no.z - self.z * no.y
              y = self.z * no.x - self.x * no.z
              z = self.x * no.y - self.y * no.x
              return Points(x, y, z)

          def absolute(self):                                               # to find out magnitude of a vector
              return pow((self.x ** 2 + self.y ** 2 + self.z ** 2), 0.5)


          if __name__ == '__main__':
              points = list()
              for i in range(4):
                  a = list(map(float, input().split()))
                  points.append(a)

              a, b, c, d = Points(*points[0]), Points(*points[1]), Points(*points[2]), Points(*points[3])
              x = (b - a).cross(c - b)
              y = (c - b).cross(d - c)
              angle = math.acos(x.dot(y) / (x.absolute() * y.absolute()))

              print("%.2f" % math.degrees(angle))
